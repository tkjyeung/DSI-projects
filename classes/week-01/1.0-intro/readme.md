## Introduction(s) - (20 min)

Ice breaker -- let's introduce ourselves ..

1. Find another student you do not know yet (1x1)

2. Introduce yourself to him/her - (5 min)
  - your name
  - age, gender, where you live, background, study, work, hobbies, sports, languages
  - something interesting
  - one blatant lie ..

3. Find another pair of students (2x2)
4. Introduce your colleagues to the other pair - (5 min) ..

5. Class introduction - (10 min)
 - Now, one person of each pair should introduce one person of the other pair to the whole class

## Data Scientist - (10 min)

What is this (mythical) creature call data scientist?

### Hacker, analyst, communicator, trusted adviser

> What kind of person does all this? What abilities make a data scientist successful? Think of him or her as a **hybrid of data hacker, analyst, communicator, and trusted adviser**. The combination is extremely powerful—and rare.

> Data scientists’ most basic, universal skill is the ability to **write code**. This may be less true in five years’ time, when many more people will have the title “data scientist” on their business cards. More enduring will be the **need** for data scientists to **communicate in language that all their stakeholders understand**—and to demonstrate the special skills involved in **storytelling with data**, whether **verbally, visually, or—ideally—both**.

## What do we expect from you?


- **Be respectful**
  - Be respectful to the GA staff
  - Be respectful to your colleagues
  - Be respectful to people outside GA
    - Abide by GA's standards of conduct
  - Be respectful to the class  
    - Don't engage in practices that might disturb others
    - Be on time for classes
    - Leave your phone on silent and refrain from using it ..

- **Be engaged and be helpful**
  - GA teaching is based on active and collaborative learning
    - Learn by doing    
      - Do exercises, homework, projects    
      - Participate in class
      - Let others participate
    - Collaborate with colleagues
      - Learn by helping others
      - Learn to ask for help ..

Note on the use of slack channel:
  - the instructors will only answer questions when there is **enough evidence** that students have try to solve the problem themselves **and** have engaged in a discussion with other colleagues about the problem.
    - i.e. **ask at least two other students** before escalating the question to the instructors ..

If you are struggling with this model, please **let us know**!
- *Your success is our top priority!* ..


## What can you expect from us?

- We will give you individualized feedback
- Rotating instructor & TA lectures
- If you start falling behind we will help you
- Monitor slack channels
  - but we won't be online 24/7

## That's it!

- We now know a bit about ourselves, about data science and how we are going to spend the next 12 weeks together!

Let's start learning now
