## Introduction: Reflection (5 mins)

On Fridays, during your Data Science Immersive course, we'll pause for an hour to detach ourselves from the course content and reflect. Our reflection will focus on the following questions:

- Q: What has been a highlight of the past week for you?
- Q: What's one area of improvement you're focused on for yourself next week?
- Q: Is there anything we've been doing very well?
- Q: Is there anything you would like us to be doing differently next week?
- Q: Please leave a shout-out for a classmate or classmates.

You will have time to document your answers to each of these questions in an online survey as well as discuss each question in a group setting facilitated by a member of the instructional team.

## Guided Practice: Reflection Part 1 (25 mins)

This class is going to be split into two groups:

- Group one will be given a link to an online survey provided by the instructor; for the next 25 minutes, think about and write in your answers to the questions in the survey.

- Group two will be further spit into two squads - each squad will have a discussion led by a member of the instructional team. The discussion will walk through each of the questions above.

Groups will be switched in the next section.

## Guided Practice: Reflection Part 2 (25 mins)

> Note: Switch the groups - students who were filling out the survey will now be in discussion groups led by instructional team members; students who were in discussion groups will now have 25 minutes to record their thoughts and feelings in the online survey.

## Conclusion (5 mins)

Your instructional team at General Assembly uses all the information at our disposal to create the best possible learning experience for you and your classmates. We'll look over the responses to your surveys and use them to make informed decisions about how to structure future sessions and, if necessary, make adjustments to aspects of the course ..

> Note: Feel free to identify common themes during your group reflection periods, as long as they are appropriate.
